# Microsoft Excel
Exploratory data analysis in Microsoft Excel.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasmeet0516/bird-flu-dataset-avian-influenza?resource=download
- This dataset was uploaded to Kaggle by the user Jasmeeto516.
- It is a vast dataset around the topic of avian influenza (H5N1) infections in Irish bird species including individual bird details, precise locational information and binomial data (positive or negative for H5N1).

DISCLAIMER: The data manipulation and analysis shown here has not been conducted with the usual scientific rigor I would apply; this EDA is made simply to showcase my ability with Microsoft Excel. Certain factors have been omitted/changed to streamline my presentation, however in a real-world setting all relevant data would be included. If I were to expand on this analysis, I would likely use R to produce a binomial generalised linear model for example. I could also use GIS to make a heatmap of infections by locality. I used mainly one dataset for this section of my portfolio, however several things I have learned have been expressed through other examples due to relevancy.
